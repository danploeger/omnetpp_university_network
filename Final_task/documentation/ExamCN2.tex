\chapter{Network Description}
Because of a construction site near Channel 4 which might accidentally damage the cables 
used for internet connection,
a point-to-point radio link should be implemented to ensure network connection.
In the following, the new network configuration as depicted in \ref{fig:network} will be evaluated.

\section{General Description of the Network's Main Components}
By Nina Piontek.

The network core is a set up with 2 Routers, Main Router and Remote Router, connected with a Point-to-Point Link. 
Towards the Main Router the Porters Office' Computer and the Computer of the Professor giving the remote Lecture are connected.
The Main Router is the Gateway for the shared Internet Connection of the University.

Towards the Remote Router the Access Point for WLAN and the Security Camera are connected.
The Access Point provides Wireless Lan for Students at Channel 4. The Computer for the Video Lecture at Channel 4 
is connected via WLAN as well.



\section{Network Services and Requirements}
By Nina Piontek.

In this set up the Network performance regarding the Video Lecture is evaluated with the following Services in
use:\\
\begin{enumerate}
 \item WLAN for Webbrowsing
 \item FTP Service for Uploading a file to a Server in the Internet (used by one Student) 
 \item Video Lecture streamed in both directions from the Main Campus to Channel 4
 \item Security Camera streaming from Channel 4 to the Porters Office  at the Main Campus
\end{enumerate}

The network should provide a certain Quality of Service for the Video Lecture and the Security Camera.
The Criteria are:\\
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The Video Data should not take more than 100ms to be delivered to the destination in both directions.
 \item There should only be a loss of data at most of 5$ \% $
\end{enumerate}

\section{General Assumptions on the Model}
By Nina Piontek.

Since the overall Goal is to evaluate the network performance regarding the Qos during the Video Lecture, we will assume an assessment period
of around 90 minutes. The WLAN at Channel 4 will in general be used by the Students, which surf the Web during the Video Lecture and the Student 
who uploads a file. Optional the Camera will be turned on or switched off to evaluate the networks behavior with and without the additional
traffic load.
\subsection{HTTP Traffic}
\label{chapter_http_traffic}
By Daniel Ploeger.

In order to model the student web browsing behavior in 
a meaningful way, captured browsing statistics have been provided by the computer center in a trace file. 
This chapter shortly explains the statistical behavior behind the given HTTP 
requests and responses. The response sample traces (download statistics) are widely 
distributed in the range of less than 500 Bytes up to more than 4 Mbyte 
(see figure \ref{fig:trace} top).
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{trace_distribution.eps}
    \label{fig:trace}
    \caption{HTTP Traffic Analysis}
\end{figure}

Distribution fitting analysis shows that the statistical behavior if
 partitioned in a smaller number of bins roughly behaves like a negative 
exponential distribution with a mean value of 0.789 Mbyte (see figure \ref{fig:trace} center). 
The phrase "roughly" means that while the statistical goodness of fit tests accepts
 this distribution, the actual data has an overweight of small messages compared to
 the expected values (see figure \ref{fig:trace} bottom). An exponential distribution with the
 mean of 0.789 Mbyte is used in this report for simulation nonetheless. 
This is a conservative approach and guarantees an upper bound in the distribution:
 if the actual browsing behavior uses smaller HTTP responses with a slightly higher
 probability, the QoS assumptions from the following chapters are going to be met 
in practice as well.

\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

Since the default configuration for the Links is full-duplex, the performance of the Uplink and the Downlink is evaluated independently.
\par When the Camera is turned off, the Uplink to the Main Campus is shared between the FTP Upload and the Video Lecture (Video Conference).
Since the Video Conference is sending with a constant Data Rate of 280kbit/s, the remaining 
11,72 Mbit/s can be used by the FTP Upload. That means, that the Upload could theoretically run with 11,72Mbit/s.

  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics-02.png}
    
    \caption{Utilization of the Radio Link without the Security Camera}
\end{figure}

On the Downlink the Data Rate of 12Mbit/s is shared between the Students browsing the Web (HTTP Service) and the Video Lecture (Video Conference).
Since the Downlink is utilized by the Video Lecture by 280kbit/s , the remaining 11,7Mbit/s 
can be theoretically used by the HTTP Service. With 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{0.789MiB}{15s}=\frac{441.24kbit}{s}
\end{equation}
we can see, that, theoretically up to 26 Users can use the Downlink for HTTP Traffic.
The value $0.789MiB$ is the value extracted from the trace file. It is the Mean of the packetlength downloaded by the Students whne surfing the web. For Details see \ref{chapter_http_traffic}





\section{Network Behavior  Expectations with CCTV camera turned on}
By Daniel Ploeger.

The point-to-point radio link between remote and main router has a data rate of 12 Mbit/s and by this is the weakest single link within the proposed network. All other connection speeds are multiples of this data rate. Since all data has to pass this link, for this theoretical behavior analysis it is considered to be the network bottleneck.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics-01.eps}
    \label{fig:radio_link_theory_on}
    \caption{Max. Possible Utilization of the Radio Link With the CCTV Camera Streaming}
\end{figure}

The network contains several applications which have their main impact either on the download connection from the main router to the remote router, or on the upload connection in the other direction. The respective opposite direction of an application may be neglected, since it mainly consists of very small messages for connection management or empty network packets. For this reason, theoretical down- and upload utilization is examined independently from each other in this chapter. 

The only exception is the video conference, which utilizes both, up- and download equally. The video stream consumes 280 kbit/s for transmission of 1388 Bytes of payload plus 12 Byte RTP protocol headers. It does this every 40 ms and in both directions.

\subsection{Upload Connection, Remote to Main Router}
Aside from the video conference which uses 280 kbit/s, two more applications make use of the upload direction. Firstly, the CCTV camera sends 10 kByte every 40 ms, which adds up to 2,000 kbit/s. The second application is the FTP upload. It tries to maximize network utilization and should therefore consume the biggest part of the remaining 9,720 kbit/s of the total 12,000 kbit/s data rate (see figure \ref{fig:radio_link_theory_on} left).

\subsection{Download Connection, Main to Remote Router}
Other than the video conference, the only application which makes use of the download direction is the web browsing. As stated before, web browsing is modeled as the download of files with an exponentially distributed size with a mean of 0.789 Mbyte (see chapter \ref{chapter_http_traffic}). The client's assumption states that a web browsing user waits a certain time before he downloads the next file. The waiting time is assumed to be exponentially distributed with a mean of 15 seconds. This leads to an expected average data rate of 420.8 kbit/s per user. Therefore, if all users download in a well-distributed way, up to 27 users are able to browse simultaneously via the network connection (see figure \ref{fig:radio_link_theory_on} right).

\subsection{Simulation Results}
\section{Video Lecture}
The overall goal is to ensure a good Quality of Service for the Video Lecture in both directions.
A good Quality of Service is achieved, if there are only up 5 $\%$ loss of data
on the way from the Professors Laptop to the Students watching the Lecture in Channel 4. Also the average delay of data travelling from the professor to the Students has to be smaller than 100ms.
Data loss (named Packet Loss in ~\ref{fig:losslecdown}) occurs, when the traffic load on the network is too high, and the network nodes cannot process all packets.
The data is then dropped. Data is delayed for example by Queuing at Routers.
In figure  ~\ref{fig:losslecdown} the packet loss rate depending on the number of
Webusers is depicted. Packet loss is calculated with
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\textnormal{total number bits sent}}{\textnormal{total number of packets received}} + \textnormal{number of packets arrived at time} > 100ms
\end{equation}
The packetloss should not exceed 5$\%$ during the simulation.
With increasing number of users, the packet loss increses, because the 
workload on the network nodes like routers is too high.
The Simulation results indicate, that the maximum bumber of Clients surfing the 
web without impairing the Video Lecture is about 7 users.
The blue lines indicate the confidence intervals. Confidence Intervals give the area in which 
the true mean of the probability distribution that underlies the gathered data will most likely lie with a probability of 90$\%$.
The Mean we are estimating is the average packet loss rate. The estimated Mean taken from the simulation results is depicted in the figure with a blue star.
The estimated Mean lies within the calculated confidence intervals for each number of users. This indicates that the estimated mean is a good estimate of the true mean.
It is safe to assume that only 6 users can use the Web, while the Video Lecture is on.
The confidence interval for 6 users does not cross the 5$\%$ acceptable packet loss 
rate indicated by the red line. So the Quality of service is guaranteed with a probability of 90$\%$, because the actual mean of the
underlying distribution will have its mean in the depicted interval with a probabiity of 90$\%$.

Investigating the source of the packet drops, Figure ~\ref{fig:mainRdrops} shows the packet drops at the main router, which increase with the number of 
web users. With increasing Webusers more data is lost at at the main router. Further investigation of the loss rate at the Access Point showed no indication that 
the loss of data is caused by collisions during transmission from Access Point to Wlan clients.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \label{fig:losslecdown}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{off_loss_conf_download.eps}
  
    \caption{Loss Downlink}
\end{figure}
The bootleneck of that configuration without the security camera constantly streaming to the main campus 
is the radio link.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
 \label{fig:mainRdrops}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{off_main_router_drops.eps}
    \caption{Drops Main Router (Downlink)}
\end{figure}

It is recommended to increase the radio links data rate to solve the problem of packet loss at the main routers output. It would also be possible to increase the Quality of Service for the Video Lecture 
by priorising the video data or a better video codec to make the data smaller.

In the Uplink there is no loss of data at the remote routers queue on the radio link.(See ~\ref{fig:remoteRdrops}).
This means no impact on the Quality of Service for the Video Lecture.

     \label{fig:remoteRdrops}
\end{figure}


\section{Problems with FTP}
The networks behaviour on the Uplink is very unusual. Since the FTP Client uploading a file is using TCP it therefore usually adjusts its upload speed if the network can provide a higher datarate.
As we can see in ~\ref{fig:ftpUpR}, the FTP Client starts with an average upload rate of around 1250kbit/s , despite the fact, that it could theoretically transmit with a datarate of up  11,7Mbit/s.
The Video Conference is using UDP and sending with constant datarate of 280kbit/s without adjusting its upload rate. This means, that the FTP client really has 11,7Mbit/s for Upload.
The Problem might be our implementation of the FTP Upload.

    \caption{Average Upload Rate for the FTP Upload depending on the number of users}
\end{figure}

\section{Webbrowsing}
As we can see in \ref{fig:httpDR} with increasing number of Students using the Wlan for Webbrowsing, the average download rate decreases only slightly over time. Webbrowsing is still possible, but with decreased download speed.
To provide a higher download rate the data rate of the radio link has to be increased.
