In this document the network depicted in fig1 is evaluated regarding given Qos Requirements.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Network}
Bild
\section{General Assumptions}
Since the overall Goal is to evaluate the network performance regarding the Qos during the Video Lecture, we will assume an assessment period
of around 90 minutes. Before the Video Lecture starts, the Network will in general be used by the Students, which surf the Web at the Audimax, the Student 
who uploads a file. Optional the Camera will be turned on or switched off to evaluate the networks behavior with and without the additional
traffic load.
\section{HTTP Service}
average download rate of the http client
how many students can use the web while the file is uploaded, the camera is streaming and the professor is giving the lecture, so that the
Qos  requirements ( delay, loss rate ) are still met?
\subsection{Expectations and theoretical Justification}
\section{Video Conference}
How do  the other apps influence the call.
Is it required to Pause the CCTV camera during the video lecture?
Is the Radio Link sufficient for the Video Call? Improvements of the Qos?
\subsection{Influence of CCTV Camera on Video Conference}
Where is the main bootleneck of the network, when the CCTV camera is turned on?
Where is the main bootleneck of the network, when the CCTV camera is turned off?
\subsubsection{Expectations and theoretical Justification}
Confidence Intervals 
\subsubsection{Simulation Results and Interpretation regarding the Expectations}
\section{Radio Link}
Is the radio link sufficient for all services to meet te Qos of all Apps?

\section{FTP Service}
